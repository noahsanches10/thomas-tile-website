The right tile can make or break a remodel. In East Tennessee homes, we see a lot of beautiful designs fail early because the material choice didn’t match the space.

At Thomas TileWorks, we focus on selecting tile based on moisture exposure, traffic level, slip resistance, and long-term maintenance. This guide helps you understand where each type performs best.

## Bathroom Floors

Bathroom floors need grip, durability, and easy cleanup.

### Best options
- Porcelain tile with matte or textured finish
- Mosaic tile sheets (great traction due to more grout joints)
- Natural stone (sealed and maintained correctly)

### Avoid
- Highly polished tile in wet areas
- Soft, porous materials that stain easily

For high-use family bathrooms, porcelain is usually the most practical long-term choice.

## Shower Walls and Shower Floors

Custom showers require tile that looks great and performs under constant moisture.

### Shower walls
- Large-format porcelain for clean, modern lines
- Marble-look porcelain for a premium look with lower maintenance
- Ceramic or porcelain subway tile for classic style

### Shower floors
- Smaller tile formats or mosaics for better slope conformity and traction
- Slip-resistant finishes only

The waterproofing system and prep behind the tile matter as much as the tile itself.

## Kitchen Floors

Kitchen tile has to handle spills, daily traffic, dropped items, and frequent cleaning.

### Best options
- Porcelain tile (top choice for strength and low porosity)
- Durable ceramic in medium-traffic kitchens
- Stone-look porcelain for a natural look without high upkeep

### Design tip
Choose grout color strategically. Mid-tone grout usually hides normal wear better than very light grout.

## Kitchen Backsplashes

Backsplashes are one of the highest-impact upgrades in a kitchen remodel.

### Popular choices
- Subway tile for timeless style
- Zellige-look tile for handcrafted texture
- Large-format slabs/panels for minimal grout lines
- Mosaic accents for focal points around cooktops

This area is perfect for style expression while keeping installation practical and cleanable.

## Living Areas and Main Walkways

Open-concept homes benefit from tile that can carry one cohesive look across multiple rooms.

### Best options
- Wood-look porcelain planks
- Large-format porcelain tile
- Stone-look porcelain for upscale, durable finishes

Use movement joints and proper layout planning in larger spaces to support long-term performance.

## Outdoor Patios and Exterior Areas

Outdoor tile needs weather resistance, traction, and proper substrate prep.

### Best options
- Exterior-rated porcelain pavers
- Slip-resistant textured tile

### Key requirement
Outdoor installations need proper drainage and movement accommodation. Material choice alone is not enough.

## Tile Maintenance Areas and Commercial Touch-Ups

For maintenance and repair work, matching existing tile is often the biggest challenge.

### Practical strategy
- Keep attic/garage spare boxes after every remodel
- Document manufacturer and color at install time
- Use durable, readily available lines in high-wear areas

This makes future repairs faster, cleaner, and more cost-effective.

## Choosing the Right Tile for Your Project

Before choosing tile, answer these questions:
- Is this area frequently wet?
- Is slip resistance a priority?
- How much traffic will this surface get?
- Do you want a low-maintenance or high-character finish?

The best tile decision balances design and performance.

## Final Thoughts

Bathroom remodels, kitchen remodels, custom showers, and maintenance projects all benefit from one core principle: choose materials for how you actually live in the space.
